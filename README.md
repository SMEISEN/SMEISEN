### Hi there 👋

I’m currently working on methods to automate time series forecasting in [smart grid applications](https://www.elab2.kit.edu/english/index.php)! ⚙️📈⚡

### Latest Work 🚀

#### 2022
- [Review of automated time series forecasting pipelines (pre-print)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01712)

#### 2021
- [A Lightweight User Interface for Smart Charging of Electric Vehicles: A Real-World Application](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9621604)
- [Concepts for Automated Machine Learning in Smart Grid Applications](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000138532)
- [Smart Charging of Electric Vehicles with Cloud-based Optimization and a Lightweight User Interface: A Real-World Application in the Energy Lab 2.0: Poster](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447555.3466571)

### Projects 😎

#### RidingCoach Web Application 🏍️🚲
Web application for motorcycle and mountain bike racers to organize maintenance, spare parts, and tires, furthermore to log and analyze training sessions and chassis set-ups.
**[Check out my demo](https://riding-coach-demo.herokuapp.com/)!** (_allocating server resources may take some time during the first start of the app_)

#### Smart Charging Wizard Web Application 🚗🔌⚡️ 
Smart charging, i.e. the controlled and coordinated charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs) seems promising for efficient electric mobility. According concepts, however, require sufficient user acceptance. For this purpose, the **[Smart Charging Wizard](https://energylabsmartcharging.github.io/Smart-Charging-Wizard/)** provides a lightweight User Interface (UI) that makes smart charging more transparent. In particular, the utilization of energy and time flexibilities in EV charging events to reduce both EV operating cost and battery aging is illustrated.

#### pyWATTS: Python Workflow Automation Tool for Time-Series ⚙️📈
The goals of [pyWATTS](https://github.com/KIT-IAI/pyWATTS) are i) to support researchers in conducting automated time series experiments independent of the execution environment and ii) to make methods developed during the research easily reusable for other researchers.
